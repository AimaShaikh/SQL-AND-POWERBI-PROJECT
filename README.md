The project commenced by importing raw, unprocessed data into SQL Server, followed by the meticulous application of queries tailored to the specific requirements outlined in the problem statement. The subsequent step involved establishing a seamless connection between SQL Server and Power BI, through which the dataset underwent a comprehensive cleansing process leveraging Power Query. With the refined data in hand, an interactive and visually engaging dashboard was crafted using the powerful capabilities of Power BI. Ultimately, the project culminated in the transformation of the processed data into a well-structured report, achieved through thoughtful data processing techniques within Power BI. This journey exemplified a holistic approach to data analysis and visualization, seamlessly integrating SQL Server's querying prowess and Power BI's dynamic visualization tools to distill raw data into actionable insights presented cohesively in a comprehensive report.
